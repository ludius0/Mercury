# Mercury
My own experimental neural network framework. In development...
Goal of the Mercury is to be mini-framework akin to pytorch (deliver same clarity and same or better speed than pytorch).

Should be alright with python 3.8.0+. Also it's builded on numpy and Tensor is just wrapper around it.

List to do:
- Upgrade Tensor
- add GPU acceleration (numba)
- implement basic NN

Inspired by: Pytorch, Micrograd / Tinygrad and MyGrad.
