# ProtoSaturn
My own experimental neural network framework. In development...

Should be alright with python 3.8.0+. Also it's builded on numpy and Tensor is just wrapper around numpy.

List to do:
- add penalization for loss
- Upgrade Tensor
- add GPU acceleration (numba)
- implement MSELoss
- implement Conv and Rnn

inspired by Tinygrad/micrograd/nnfs(from sentdex)/pytorch
